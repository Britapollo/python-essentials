# 🌐 Week 2 - Enhanced HTML Elements

Today, I continued my HTML learning journey, taking it slowly but steadily. I explored and experimented with several enhanced HTML elements that go beyond the basic tags. Here’s what I covered and understood:

---

## 📘 1. Definition Lists

I learned how to structure **definition lists** using `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>`. These are great for explaining terms and their meanings.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Backend</dt>
  <dd>A 'server' software that users do not interact with directly and where application logic resides.</dd>
  <dt>Frontend</dt>
  <dd>The presentation layer of software where users interact with.</dd>
</dl>
```

## 📋 2. Nested Lists

I practiced creating **nested lists** with combinations of ordered and unordered lists. These help organize hierarchical data like categories and subcategories.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Fruits
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Apple
        <ul>
          <li>Red Apple</li>
          <li>Green Apple</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Banana</li>
      <li>Cherry</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Vegetables
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Carrot</li>
      <li>Broccoli</li>
      <li>Spinach</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
```

## 🖼️ 3. Images

I learned how to add **images** using both local file paths and external URLs. I also practiced using `alt` text for accessibility and `width`/`height` for sizing.

---

## 🎥 4. Video & 🔊 5. Audio

I embedded a video using the `<video>` tag with the `controls` attribute and set fallback text for unsupported browsers. I also experimented with embedding an audio file using `<audio>`—though I still need to provide an actual audio source.

---

## 📊 6. Tables

Tables were a bit tricky, but I understood how to structure them using `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`. This helps when presenting data in a grid format.

---

## 🧾 7. Forms

Finally, I explored building basic **forms** with input types like text, email, file upload, textarea, and dropdown selects. I also learned about form attributes like `action`, `method`, and `enctype`.

## 🧠 What This Really Means

Each section taught me something new about how websites handle structure, content, and user interaction. Little by little, I'm starting to understand how HTML works beyond just headings and paragraphs. I now see how it's the foundation for everything we build on the web.

## ✅ What’s Next?

I'll keep experimenting with CSS next to style these elements, and eventually learn JavaScript to make them dynamic. One step at a time.
